# docker drupal 10
 Dockerized version of Drupal 10

This was created so I could quickly compose a drupal build on Docker. My work environment restricted the use of homebrew, which made it difficult to install PHP and Composer. However I wanted to be able to have control over Drupal files on my local machine, so I could make updates faster to themes and modules.
